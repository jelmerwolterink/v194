title: Scale-Equivariant UNet for Histopathology Image Segmentation
abstract: Digital histopathology slides are scanned and viewed under different magnifications
  and stored as images at different resolutions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  trained on such images at a given scale fail to generalise to those at different
  scales.  This inability is often addressed by augmenting training data with re-scaled
  images, allowing a model with sufficient capacity to learn the requisite patterns.
  Alternatively, designing CNN filters to be scale-equivariant frees up model capacity
  to learn discriminative features. In this paper, we propose the Scale-Equivariant
  UNet (SEUNet) for image segmentation by building on scale-space theory. The SEUNet
  contains groups of filters that are linear combinations of Gaussian basis filters,
  whose scale parameters are trainable but constrained to span disjoint scales through
  the layers of the network. Extensive experiments on a nuclei segmentation dataset
  and a tissue type segmentation dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms other
  approaches, with much fewer trainable parameters.
