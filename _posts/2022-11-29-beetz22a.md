title: Reconstructing 3D Cardiac Anatomies from Misaligned Multi-View Magnetic Resonance
  Images with Mesh Deformation U-Nets
abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) representations of cardiac anatomy and
  function are crucial for improving cardiac disease diagnosis beyond strictly volume-based
  biomarkers used in current clinical practice, as well as for the accurate simulation
  of cardiac electrophysiology and mechanics. However, current gold standard cardiac
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols typically only acquire a set of 2D slices
  to approximate the true 3D morphology of the underlying heart. In this work, we
  propose a novel geometric deep learning method, the \emph{Mesh Deformation U-Net},
  to reconstruct 3D cardiac surface meshes from 2D MRI slices as the key part of a
  fully automatic end-to-end pipeline. Its architecture combines spectral graph convolutions
  and mesh sampling operations in a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure to enable
  efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on mesh data. A targeted preprocessing
  step approximately fits a template mesh to the sparse MRI contours, before the Mesh
  Deformation U-Net corrects for motion-induced slice misalignment by simultaneously
  utilising information from multiple MRI views and the template-induced anatomical
  shape prior. We evaluate the Mesh Deformation U-Net on a large synthetic dataset
  of heart anatomies and outperform multiple benchmark approaches while achieving
  small reconstruction errors below the pixel size of the underlying image resolution
  for three different cardiac substructures. Furthermore, we apply the pre-trained
  Mesh Deformation U-Net as the key component of a 4-step reconstruction pipeline
  to cine magnetic resonance images of the UK Biobank and observe realistic heart
  reconstructions on both a local and global level. We calculate multiple widely used
  clinical metrics for the reconstructed meshes and obtain values in line with other
  large-scale population studies.
