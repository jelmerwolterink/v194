title: A Comparative Study of Graph Neural Networks for Shape Classification in Neuroimaging
abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising approach for the analysis
  of non-Euclidean data such as meshes. In medical imaging, mesh-like data plays an
  important role for modelling anatomical structures, and shape classification can
  be used in computer aided diagnosis and disease detection. However, with a plethora
  of options, the best architectural choices for medical shape analysis using GNNs
  remain unclear.\newline We conduct a comparative analysis to provide practitioners
  with an overview of the current state-of-the-art in geometric deep learning for
  shape classification in neuroimaging. Using biological sex classification as a proof-of-concept
  task, we find that using FPFH as node features substantially improves GNN performance
  and generalisation to out-of-distribution data; we compare the performance of three
  alternative convolutional layers; and we reinforce the importance of data augmentation
  for graph based learning. We then confirm these results hold for a clinically relevant
  task, using the classification of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
