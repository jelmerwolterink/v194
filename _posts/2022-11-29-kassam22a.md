title: Detecting Large Vessel Occlusions using Graph Deep Learning
abstract: Large vessel occlusions (LVO) typically lead to severe ischemia of brain
  parenchyma. Identifying such LVOs is thus a crucial objective in stroke diagnosis.
  As shortening the time to treatment is essential for a good outcome, fast automated
  detection can be a valuable tool in clinical routine. This can be achieved using
  deep learning approaches. In a CTA scan, an LVO can be detected as an unexpected
  interruption in the contrast-enhanced vessel tree. These cerebrovascular trees can
  be represented as graphs and analyzed using graph deep learning (GDL) methods. Representing
  the vasculature as a graph instead of a (very sparsely populated) Euclidean volume
  massively reduces the model input dimensionality, which promotes time and memory
  efficiency. In this study, we investigate the use of graph deep learning methods
  for classifying the presence of a large vessel occlusion compared to state-of-the-art
  image-based methods. Furthermore, the influence of vascular attributes and different
  graph topologies is investigated. The proposed model achieves performance comparable
  to the baseline with an accuracy of $0.95$ and an AUC of $0.89$. Compared to the
  image-based approach, the graph-based approach is ten times faster and requires
  80% less memory.
