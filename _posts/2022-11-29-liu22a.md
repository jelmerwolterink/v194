title: Group Convolutional Neural Networks for DWI Segmentation
abstract: We present a Group Convolutional Network for Segmentation of Diffusion Weighted
  Imaging data (DWI). The network incorporates group actions that are natural for
  this type of data, in the form of $SE(3)$ equivariant convolutions, i.e., roto-translation
  equivariant convolutions. The equivariance property provides an important inductive
  bias and may alleviate the need for data augmentation strategies. Instead of performing
  group equivariant convolutions via spectral (Fourier-based) approaches, as is common
  for $SE(3)$ equivariance, we implement direct and light-weight regular group convolutions.
  We study the effect of equivariance and weight sharing over $SE(3)$ on performances
  of the networks on DWI scans from the Human Connectome project. We show how that
  full $SE(3)$ equivariance improves segmentations, while limiting the number of learnable
  parameters.
