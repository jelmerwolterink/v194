title: A Soft-Correspondence Approach to Shape-based Disease Grading with Graph Convolutional
  Networks
abstract: 'Shape analysis provides principled means for understanding anatomical structures
  from medical images. The underlying notions of shape spaces, however, come with
  strict assumptions prohibiting the analysis of incomplete and/or topologically varying
  shapes. This work aims to alleviate these limitations by adapting the concept of
  \textit{soft correspondences}. In particular, we present a graph-based learning
  approach for morphometric classification of disease states that is based on a generalized
  notion of shape correspondences in terms of functional maps. We demonstrate the
  performance of the derived classifier on the open-access ADNI database for differentiating
  normal controls and subjects with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Notably, our experiment shows
  that our approach can improve over state-of-the-art from geometric deep learning. '
