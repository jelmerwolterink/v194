title: 'StreamNet: A WAE for White Matter Streamline Analysis'
abstract: We present StreamNet, an autoencoder architecture for the analysis of the
  highly heterogeneous geometry of large collections of white matter streamlines.
  This proposed framework takes advantage of geometry-preserving properties of the
  Wasserstein-1 metric in order to achieve direct encoding and reconstruction of entire
  bundles of streamlines. We show that the model not only accurately captures the
  distributive structures of streamlines in the population, but  is also able to achieve
  superior reconstruction performance between real and synthetic streamlines. Experimental  model
  performance is evaluated  on white matter streamlines resulting from $T1$-weighted
  diffusion imaging of $40$ healthy controls using recent state of the art bundle
  comparison metric that measures fiber-shape  similarities.
