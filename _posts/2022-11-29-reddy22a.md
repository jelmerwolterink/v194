title: Graph Neural Networks Ameliorate Potential Impacts of Imprecise Large-Scale
  Autonomous Immunofluorescence Labeling of Immune Cells on Whole Slide Images
abstract: 'The characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are essential
  for cancer prognostication and treatment through the ability to indicate the tumorâ€™s
  capacity to evade the immune system (e.g., as evidenced by nodal involvement). In
  general, presence of TILs indicates a favorable prognosis. Machine learning technologies
  have demonstrated remarkable success for localizing TILs, though these methods require
  extensive curation of manual annotations or restaining procedures that can degrade
  tissue quality, resulting in imprecise annotation. In this study, we co-registered
  tissue slides stained for both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence
  (IF) as means to rapidly perform large-scale annotation of nuclei. We integrated
  the following approaches to improve the prediction of   TILs: 1) minimized tissue
  degradation on same-section tissue restaining, 2) developed a scoring algorithm
  to improve the selection of patches for machine learning modeling and 3) utilized
  a graph neural network deep learning approach to identify relevant contextual features
  for lymphocyte prediction. Our graph neural network approach accounts for surrounding
  contextual micro/macro-architecture tissue features to facilitate interpretation
  of registered IF. The graph neural network compares favorably (F1-score=0.9235,
  AUROC=0.9462) to two alternative modeling approaches. This study brings insight
  to the importance of contextual information leveraged from within and around neighboring
  cells in a nuclei classification workflow, as well as elucidate approaches which
  enable the rapid generation of large-scale annotations of lymphocytes for machine
  learning approaches for immune phenotyping. Such approaches can help further interrogate
  the spatial biology of colorectal cancer tumors and tumor metastasis. '
