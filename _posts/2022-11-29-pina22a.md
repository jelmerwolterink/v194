title: Self-supervised graph representations of WSIs
abstract: In this manuscript we propose a framework for the analysis of whole slide
  images (WSI) on the cell entity space with self-supervised deep learning on graphs
  and explore its representation quality at different levels of application. It consists
  of a two step process in which the cell level analysis is performed locally, by
  clusters of nearby cells that can be seen as small regions of the image, in order
  to learn representations that capture the cell environment and distribution. In
  a second stage, a WSI graph is generated with these regions as nodes and the representations
  learned as initial node embeddings. The graph is leveraged for a downstream task,
  region of interest (ROI) detection addressed as a graph clustering. The representations
  outperform the evaluation baselines at both levels of application, which has been
  carried out predicting whether a cell, or region, is tumor or not based on its learned
  representations with a logistic regressor.
