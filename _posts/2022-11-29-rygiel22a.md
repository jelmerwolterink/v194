title: Eigenvector Grouping for Point Cloud Vessel Labeling
abstract: Segmentation of coronary arteries from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography
  (CCTA) is an essential step in developing various noninvasive diagnostic methods.
  In this work, we tackle the task of vessel labeling on coronary artery voxel-based
  prediction by use of point cloud artificial neural network. We propose a novel point
  aggregation technique Eigenvector Grouping (EVG), tailored to the analysis of tubular-like
  structures.  We further utilize a specifically designed post-processing technique
  Component-Wise Majority Point Voting (CMPV), to refine point cloud segmentation
  by enforcing class consistency among connected components. We show that our solution
  outperforms previously proposed methods in the vessel labeling task on a CCTA dataset
  especially, in the presence of disrupted segmentations.
