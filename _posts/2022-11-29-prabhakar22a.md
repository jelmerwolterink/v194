title: Structured Knowledge Graphs for Classifying Unseen Patterns in Radiographs
abstract: The presence of annotated datasets is crucial to the performance of modern
  machine learning algorithms. However, obtaining richly annotated datasets is not
  always possible, especially for novel or rare diseases. This becomes especially
  challenging in the realm of multi-label classification of chest radiographs, due
  to the presence of numerous unknown disease types and the limited information inherent
  to x-ray images. Ideally, we would like to develop models that can reliably label
  such unseen patterns (classes). In this work, we present a knowledge graph-based
  approach to predict such novel, unseen classes. Our method directly injects the
  semantic relationships between seen and unseen disease classes. Specifically, we
  propose a principled approach to parsing and processing a knowledge graph conditioned
  on the given task. We show that our method matches the labeling performance of the
  state-of-the-art while outperforming it on unseen classes by a  substantial \textbf{2}%
  gain on chest X-ray classification. Crucially, we demonstrate that embedding disease-specific
  knowledge as a graph provides inherent explainability. (The code is available at
