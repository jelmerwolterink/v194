title: 'GeoMorph: Geometric Deep Learning for Cortical Surface Registration'
abstract: 'We present GeoMorph, a geometric deep learning image registration framework
  that takes two cortical surfaces on the spherical space and learns a smooth displacement
  field that aligns the features on the moving surface to those on the target. GeoMorph
  starts with feature extraction: independently extracting low-dimensional feature
  representations for each input surface using graph convolutions. These learned features
  are then registered in a deep-discrete manner by learning the optimal displacement
  for a set of control points that optimizes the overlap between features across the
  two surfaces. To ensure a smooth deformation, we propose a regularization network
  that considers the input sphere structure based on a deep conditional random field
  (CRF), implemented using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Results show that GeoMorph
  improves over existing deep learning methods by improving alignment whilst generating
  smoother and more biologically plausible deformations. Performance is competitive
  with classical frameworks, generalizing well even for subjects with atypical folding
  patterns.'
