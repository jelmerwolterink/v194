title: Automated intracranial vessel labeling with learning boosted by vessel connectivity,
  radii and spatial context
abstract: 'Cerebrovascular diseases are among the world’s top causes of death and
  their screening and diagnosis rely on angiographic imaging. We focused on automated
  anatomical labeling of cerebral arteries that enables their cross-sectional quantification
  and inter-subject comparisons and thereby identification of geometric risk factors
  correlated to the cerebrovascular diseases. We used 152 cerebral TOF-MRA angiograms
  from three publicly available datasets and manually created reference labeling using
  Slicer3D. We extracted centerlines from nnU-net based segmentations using VesselVio
  and labeled them according to the reference labeling. Vessel centerline coordinates,
  in combination with additional vessel connectivity, radius and spatial context features
  were used for training seven distinct PointNet++ models. Model trained solely on
  the vessel centerline coordinates resulted in ACC of 0.93 and across-labels average
  TPR was 0.88. Including vessel radius significantly improved ACC to 0.95, and average
  TPR to 0.91. Finally, focusing spatial context to the Circle of Willis are resulted
  in best ACC of 0.96 and best average TPR of 0.93. Hence, using vessel radius and
  spatial context greatly improved vessel labeling, with the attained perfomance opening
  the avenue for clinical applications of intracranial vessel labeling. '
