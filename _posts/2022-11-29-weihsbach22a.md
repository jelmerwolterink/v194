title: 'XEdgeConv: Leveraging graph convolutions for efficient, permutation- and rotation-invariant
  dense 3D medical image segmentation'
abstract: Deep learning-based 3D anatomical segmentation models that employ convolution
  kernels have become ubiquitous in medical imaging. Currently, there exist trade-offs
  between model capacity, the complexity of inference and accuracy. To cope with geometric
  invariances, reflections (axes flips) of input data in training and test-time augmentations
  are often used, but cause redundancies in computations. Group equivariance is one
  solution to enforce invariance w.r.t. rotation and reflection, but it comes at the
  cost of complicated inference. To address those issues, we first explore a simple
  yet effective method that directly learns symmetric kernels. To further boost performance
  and achieve full rotational and reflection equivariance, we propose a novel concept
  that extends the idea of EdgeConvs, that have so far been used in geometric point
  cloud learning, from graphs into voxelised grids and integrate this into the state-of-the-art
  framework for medical 3D segmentation, the nnUNet. Our XEdgeConv kernel reduces
  the parameter count by 93% and computational operations 20-fold while maintaining
  very high segmentation accuracies on two challenging 3D multi-organ segmentation
  tasks and it clearly outperforms alternative parameter reduction strategies. \url{https://github.com/multimodallearning/XEdgeConv}
